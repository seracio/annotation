# Annotation

> A minimalist annotation component for charts in SVG

## Disclaimer

Annotations have became really importants for data visualization. This React component allows you to easily create small annotations in SVG charts. It is not as powerfull as the great [`react-annotation`](https://react-annotation.susielu.com/) by Susie Lu but can be useful in basic use cases (which represents 95% of mines).
